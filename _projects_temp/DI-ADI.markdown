## Dynamic summarization of interacting agents

Coming soon!
Networks have also been used to describe the influence and dependence between
agents or features. A popular example of this is the partial correlation graph for
Gaussian graphical models, and the corresponding
algorithms used for estimation, such as graphical lasso type algorithms and thresholding
approaches. These models seek to uncover a
parsimonious dependence representation of the data with computational complexity
that is scalable in high
feature dimension. These models and quantities often assume, however, that each sample is
i.i.d.; in many instances, we are interested in understanding the relationships
between time series data that may contain complex causal dependencies across
time. Examples of this type of model include spatio-temporal covariance
modeling.

A quantity used to measure dependence across time is directed
information. Unlike partial correlation, directed
information is assymmetric and time dependent. It was originally created
as a generalization of Shannon mutual information for a channel with
feedback. Directed
information allows for a more rich
understanding of the influence and behavior among agents. Directed information
is also closely related to Granger causality.

Work has been done to estimate directed information in the context of discrete Markov
processes, and generalized linear
models. However, these graphs are generally
considered fixed, and the time series stationary. In Chapter, this
thesis introduces adaptive directed
information (ADI) to account for time varying signals, and demonstrates specific
forms of ADI that elicit computationally efficient estimation procedures. In
Chapter, we
introduce an ensemble of ADI estimators that is more robust to the choice
of parameters and to the type of time varying signal.

Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/1.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/3.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/5.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/5.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
```
