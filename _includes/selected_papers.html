<div class=description>
Network data often arises via a series of structured interactions among a population of constituent elements. E-mail exchanges, for example, have a single sender followed by potentially multiple receivers. We introduce a statistical model, termed the Pitman-Yor hierarchical vertex components model (PY-HVCM), that is well suited for structured interaction data. The proposed PY-HVCM effectively models complex relational data by partial pooling of local information via a latent, shared population-level distribution. We also establish global sparsity and power law degree distribution, which mirrors most real-world network behavior. More information can be found <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09982">here</a>.

Directed information (DI) is a useful tool to explore time-directed interactions in multivariate data. However, as originally formulated DI is not well suited to interactions that change over time. In previous work, adaptive directed information was introduced to accommodate non-stationarity, while still preserving the utility of DI to discover complex dependencies between entities.
