Welcome to my site. I am a statistician and data scientist interested in implementing and improving state-of-the-art methods for a variety of challenging problems with data. In the past, I have worked extensively in the field of statistical signal processing and statistical models for network data. I am currently on the job market.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
